THIS PROGRAM IS NOT CREATED FOR PAID DISTRIBUTION

1.Place the files UserAgents.txt, config.json, and InstagramChecker.exe in one folder and run InstagramChecker.exe.

2.A database in the format mail:pass\phone:pass\log:pass ("Database File").

3.Public or private proxies in the supported format ip:port, which can be selected via "Proxy File" or by pasting a link with a list of proxies in the URL proxy.

4."Threads" controls the number of requests being sent.

5.After selecting the files for the database and proxies, you can start the program by clicking "Start."

6.Stopping the program may take some time to complete already running threads; click "Stop" to halt the program.

7.After stopping the program, there is an option to save the remaining lines for verification by clicking "Save remaining lines."

Possible Questions:

1.Where can I get the checker program? Look for it in the "Releases" section: Releases. https://github.com/basesof/Instagram-Checker/releases/download/instagram/InstagramChecker.exe

2.Why does nothing happen when I click the Start button? Your antivirus or firewall may be blocking requests. Try disabling it and also consider using a VPN.

3.I uploaded 1000 lines, but the program only sees 970 lines. Why? The program filters the lines to determine which ones are suitable or unsuitable for sending requests.

4.How can I improve the results of finding accounts? Use different user agents for the program in UserAgents.txt, as an example of a user agent that the program accepts.

5.Where can I find the results of the program? After launching, a folder named output_ is created, where you will find the results of the program's work.

good job everyone
